Module 5 : Packaging
Steps in Ansys –
To access thermal and electrical performance.
We will build the model in Q3D to extract the parasitic from the design.

Invoke Q3D from Ansys AEDT window.
Starting with model design –> First model is the “Die” ->> Substrate
  Creation of Die :
    Selecting Rectangle with the reqd dimension.
    Selecting the Axis and co-ordinate (here it is O (0,0,0))
    Adding thickness : select rectangle - > go to Modeler ->> Surface ->>> Thicken Sheet (0.2mm)
    Change material for Die : Edit -> Silicon

  Creation of Substrate :
    Create rectangle -> Size 5*5 with O(-1,-1,-0.1)  { -0.1 is to have gap to add Die Attach fill}
    Adding thickness : select rectangle - > go to Modeler ->> Surface ->>> Thicken Sheet (-0.5mm)
    Rearrange the axis , so that substrate on the other side of Die.
    Material of Substrate : FR4_epoxy

  Creation of Die Attach material and Epoxy fill :
    Die attach material to be added between Die and Substrate.
    Create rectangle -> Size 3*3 with O(0,0,-0.1)
    Material of Die Attach : modified epoxy

  Creation of Wire Bonding :
    Bonds need to be created between two bond pads. One on die other on substrate.
    Bond pad creation – Creation of rectangle 
    Position -> (0.2,0,2,0.2) ; Size -> 0.2 * 0.2  | For Die Bond Pad
    Adding thickness : Rectangle -> Modeler ->> Surface ->>> Thicken Sheet (0.005mm)
    Two Bond Pads : of same config one on Die other on Substrate
    Position -> (0.2,-0.8,-0.1) ; Size -> 0.2 * 0.2  | For Substrate Bond Pad
		  (Since Substrate is at depth of -0.1)

  Bond Wire : There are different bond wire specification like JEDEC. 
    go to Draw -> Bond wire
    Start from middle of Die to middle of Substrate.
    Material->Gold
