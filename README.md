  1. Thermal Simulation
    Module 3 : Thermal Simulation of Package with Ansys HFSS Icepak

     Agenda -
        To perform thermal simulation using HFSS 3D Icepak tool.
        Here we are considering QFP (Quad-Flat Pack). We will use source power and boundary condition to represent 
        the heat generated by the IC.
      Step-by Step Method :
        1. We will start by creating blank project and invoke Icepak.
        2. Selecting Pacakage type -> Toolkit ->> Geometry ->>> Packages

        3.Selecting Package type and Dimension 
          3.1 Dimensions of PKG (Here retaining the default) : 15 * 15 * 1.6 (mm)
          3.2 Die parameter : Usually its ½ of pkg ; Material & Power is selected based on the input requirement.

        4. Now we will go for setting up environment for Thermal Simulation
            Thermal condition for Die , is the Power which is being generated in the Die.
        4.1 Go to Die Source , add the total power. 
              Die on the top : where we have added the Power
        4.2 Source Boundary condition :  Temperature  which is being dissipated.
    		      Substrate : Open , it sees an ambient temperature.

        6. Add Monitors 
            Add on Die , Substrate & Underfill :  Assign Monitor -> Point ->> Temperature
        7. Mesh Generation
            go to Simulation -> Generate Mesh

        9. Analysis : Add Solution setup , Validate , Analyze All
        10. Plotting the result
           Select the complete package and plot fields.

2. Module 5 : Packaging of Die using Ansys Q3D

  Steps in Ansys –
To access thermal and electrical performance.
We will build the model in Q3D to extract the parasitic from the design.

Invoke Q3D from Ansys AEDT window.
Starting with model design –> First model is the “Die” ->> Substrate
1. Creation of Die :
a. 	 Selecting Rectangle with the reqd dimension.
b. 	 Selecting the Axis and co-ordinate (here it is O (0,0,0))
c. 	 Adding thickness : select rectangle - > go to Modeler ->> Surface ->>> Thicken Sheet (0.2mm)
d. 	  Change material for Die : Edit -> Silicon

 2.  Creation of Substrate :
    a. Create rectangle -> Size 5*5 with O(-1,-1,-0.1)  { -0.1 is to have gap to add Die Attach fill}
    b. Adding thickness : select rectangle - > go to Modeler ->> Surface ->>> Thicken Sheet (-0.5mm)
    c. Rearrange the axis , so that substrate on the other side of Die.
    d. Material of Substrate : FR4_epoxy

    S2 : Creation of Substrate
    



  Creation of Die Attach material and Epoxy fill :
    Die attach material to be added between Die and Substrate.
    Create rectangle -> Size 3*3 with O(0,0,-0.1)
    Material of Die Attach : modified epoxy

  Creation of Wire Bonding :
    Bonds need to be created between two bond pads. One on die other on substrate.
    Bond pad creation – Creation of rectangle 
    Position -> (0.2,0,2,0.2) ; Size -> 0.2 * 0.2  | For Die Bond Pad
    Adding thickness : Rectangle -> Modeler ->> Surface ->>> Thicken Sheet (0.005mm)
    Two Bond Pads : of same config one on Die other on Substrate
    Position -> (0.2,-0.8,-0.1) ; Size -> 0.2 * 0.2  | For Substrate Bond Pad
		    (Since Substrate is at depth of -0.1)



      


  Bond Wire : There are different bond wire specification like JEDEC. 
    go to Draw -> Bond wire
    Start from middle of Die to middle of Substrate.
    Material->Gold
