  1. Thermal Simulation
    Module 3 : Thermal Simulation of Package with Ansys HFSS Icepak
      Agenda -
        To perform thermal simulation using HFSS 3D Icepak tool.
        Here we are considering QFP (Quad-Flat Pack). We will use source power and boundary condition to represent 
        the heat generated by the IC.
      Step-by Step Method :
        1. We will start by creating blank project and invoke Icepak.
        2. Selecting Pacakage type -> Toolkit ->> Geometry ->>> Packages

        3.Selecting Package type and Dimension 
          3.1 Dimensions of PKG (Here retaining the default) : 15 * 15 * 1.6 (mm)
          3.2 Die parameter : Usually its Â½ of pkg ; Material & Power is selected based on the input requirement.

        4. Now we will go for setting up environment for Thermal Simulation
            Thermal condition for Die , is the Power which is being generated in the Die.
          4.1 Go to Die Source , add the total power.

         4.2 Source Boundary condition :  Temperature  which is being dissipated.
    		      Substrate : Open , it sees an ambient temperature.
        6. Add Monitors 
            Add on Die , Substrate & Underfill :  Assign Monitor -> Point ->> Temperature
        7. Mesh Generation
            go to Simulation -> Generate Mesh

        9. Analysis : Add Solution setup , Validate , Analyze All
        10. Plotting the result
           Select the complete package and plot fields.
