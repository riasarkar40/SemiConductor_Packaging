Module 3 : Thermal Simulation of Package with Ansys HFSS Icepak
  Agenda -
    To perform thermal simulation using HFSS 3D Icepak tool.
    Here we are considering QFP (Quad-Flat Pack). We will use source power and boundary condition to represent 
    the heat generated by the IC.
  Step-by Step Method :
    1. We will start by creating blank project and invoke Icepak.
    2. Selecting Pacakage type -> Toolkit ->> Geometry ->>> Packages
    3.Selecting Package type and Dimension 
      3.1 Dimensions of PKG (Here retaining the default) : 15 * 15 * 1.6 (mm)
      3.2 Die parameter : Usually its Â½ of pkg ; Material & Power is selected based on the input requirement.  
    4. Now we will go for setting up environment for Thermal Simulation
        Thermal condition for Die , is the Power which is being generated in the Die.
      4.1 Go to Die Source , add the total power. 
          Die on the top : where we have added the Power
      4.2 Source Boundary condition :  Temperature  which is being dissipated.
		      Substrate : Open , it sees an ambient temperature.
    5. Add Monitors 
        Add on Die , Substrate & Underfill :  Assign Monitor -> Point ->> Temperature
    6. Mesh Generation
        go to Simulation -> Generate Mesh
    7. Analysis : Add Solution setup , Validate , Analyze All
    8. Plotting the result
       Select the complete package and plot fields.
